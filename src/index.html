	<h3>Values</h3>
	<h4>I'm Lazy</h4>
	<p>
	  Make all decision with the understanding that I'm lazy as fuck.
	  I don't want to have to debug things.
	  I hate planning on doing something, but then bim bam boom, something is broken.
	</p>
	<h4>Takes care of Itself</h4>
	<p>
	  I don't want to have take care of my tech like its a second child.
	</p>
	<h4>Prefer a Higher Upfront cost to Running cost</h4>
	<p>
	  Take the time to set something up "right" in the first place.
	  It's extremely unlikely I will come back to redo the project.
